                        thrives here, tip-toeing the line between artistic passion and
                        corporate assimilation. Buskers stand on street corners with
                        nothing but their aspirations and a beat up guitar case, while the
                        wealthy rub shoulders with overworked gallery owners and preening
                        artists. Dreams are the currency of the art district...just be careful not to let
                        yours fall into the wrong hands.</p>

                <p>When you organize a protest, roll with a Circle of your
                    fellow organizers. On a hit, your protest puts pressure
                    on a powerful NPC of your choice; they take a -1
                    ongoing through the next faction turn. On a 10+, the
                    leader of another faction takes interest in your cause
                    and delivers a Debt, powerful resources, or secret
                    information that aids your cause. On a miss, someone
                    you trusted leaks your secrets to a dangerous foe.</p>

                <p>When you posture for clout in front of well-connected
                    NPCs, roll with Mind. On a hit, they buy your ruse;
                    take +1 Status with a relevant Circle until time passes
                    or your deception is revealed. On a 7-9, they require
                    you to prove yourself or risk retribution. On a miss,
                    your humblebragging attracts the attention of a rival
                    to whom you owe an uncomfortably large Debt; take
                    -1 ongoing when refusing to honor your Debts to
                    anyone from their Circle until time passes.</p>
                <div class="sheet-hubMove">PROMISES, PROMISES</div>
                <p>When you persuade an NPC by promising concrete
                    assistance in pursuing their dreams, mark corruption
                    to take a 10+ instead of rolling. If you cannot fulfill
                    your promise by the end of the next session, mark
                    another corruption.</p>
